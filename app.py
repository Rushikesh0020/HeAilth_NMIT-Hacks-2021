The primary objective of treatment is to ensure complete cure, that is the rapid and full elimination of the Plasmodium parasite from the patient‚Äôs blood, in order to prevent progression of uncomplicated malaria to severe disease or death, and to chronic infection that leads to malaria-related anaemia. From a public health perspective, treatment is meant to reduce transmission of the infection to others, by reducing the infectious reservoir and by preventing the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial medicines. Follow this Treatment table given in the link to get rid off malaria quickly.üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è         https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/Malaria_Treatment_Table.pdf "
