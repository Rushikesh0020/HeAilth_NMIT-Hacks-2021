# HeAilth_NMIT-Hacks-2021
Multiclass classification of 14 different Thorax diseases as an aid for radiologistâ€™s diagnosis.

# Problem Statement
The chest X-ray is one of the most commonly accessible radiological examinations for screening and diagnosis
of many lung diseases. A tremendous number of X-ray
imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are
accumulated and stored in many modern hospitalsâ€™ Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On
the other side, it is still an open question how this type
of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable
imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. 

# Solution (in-short)
we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic diseases can
be detected and even spatially-located via a supervised multi-class image classification. 

## Changes Suggested By Judges 
       1. Web-App or Mobile App Integration of working module. 
       2. Refer other works done by the people and collect information accordingly and present them at Round 2 of Judging.

## First Update: Added a simple Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model to predict Thorax Diseases
       1. Data Preprocessing (Data Augmentation, Image Conversion, Converting Images to Greyscale)
       2. Image inputs to CNN Model
       3. Predicted required output
